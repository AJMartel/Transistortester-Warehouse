# Transistortester Warehouse

The Transistortester is a device for identifying and checking electronic
components. It also offers additional functionality like a PWM signal
generator for example. And it's OSHW.

This repo is meant to provide a convenient way to download firmware packages,
documentation files, PCB files and more.

The project's webpage is

and the official (and cumbersome) repo is
